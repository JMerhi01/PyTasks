~~~
- divide(num1, num2) 
~~~
Returns the answer of num1 divided by num2
~~~
- modulo(num1, num2)

### User Interface
When the program is run, users can pick from a menu of available operations
The options range from (1,2,3,4,5,6,7).
### Input
After operation selection, the user is prompted to enter two numbers, (num1) and (num2).
This is then converted to floating numbers using 'float()'
### Output 
The selected operation is performed on the chosen numbers and the result is printed to the console.
### Errors
If the user enters a number other than 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 then they will be presented with an error "Invalid Input"
